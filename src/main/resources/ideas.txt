store max plank length

create weighted average gap distance (over max plank length)

average plank lengths weighted by distance to centre - either separate horiz and vert, or pythagoras

shuffle neighbour function - use to start with under brief hill climb to get initial

use longs for higher iterations

gaps two (n?) rows down?
